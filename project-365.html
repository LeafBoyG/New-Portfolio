                <h2>The Concept</h2>
                <p>A "365 Project" is a personal challenge to create one piece of art every day for an entire year. For me, the goal was to master my camera's manual settings, find beauty in the mundane, and build a consistent creative habit. The only rule: one new photo, taken and edited, every single day.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>The Journey</h2>
                <p>This project was a marathon. Some days, inspiration was easy. Other days, finding a compelling shot at 11 PM was a test of willpower. I documented everything from early morning light to street portraits to still-life experiments in my kitchen. The process forced me to look at the world differently, constantly searching for composition and light.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>The Highlights (The Gallery)</h2>
                <p>Showing 365 photos would be impossible. Here is a curated selection of 12 images that represent the best of this year-long journey, showcasing my growth in composition, lighting, and editing.</p>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>Beyond the technical skills, this project taught me resilience. It proved that I can commit to a long-term goal and produce high-quality work even under pressure. I learned that creativity isn't a flash of inspiration; it's the result of showing up every single day.</p>
